## Background 

The purpose of this project is to us D3 js to build a scatter plot given a csv file of data comparing the median age of the 50 states with the percentage of smokers in the state. 

## Task 

Create a scatter plot between Smokers vs. Age.
Using D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

Include state abbreviations in the circles.

Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
